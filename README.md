## :open_mouth: Welcome to my deranged Data Science journey :open_mouth:
I'm a bachelor's student in Cognitive Data Science and I created this GitHub with the intent to display not just the skill I've acquired but the journey to get there. The content within it is plagued with unnecessary sassy comments and a sprinkled with too much storytelling. This condition is terminal and though I try to limit my audacious remarks they somehow always manage to seep into my content. So for any future employees or talent acquisition please disregard the username and excessive sass.

## Skills & Technologies
- _Programming Languages:_ Python, Javascript (Typescript), F#, C# (Unity), VBA / Officescripts
- _Web Development:_ HTML, CSS, React, Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator
- _Tools:_ Git, Excel
- _Databases:_ There should definetily be something here...
- _Libraries:_ NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Plotly, Altair

## Projects
So far, projects have been purely self-indulgent for educational purposes and practice, pertaining to whatever I found interesting at that moment. Like a feather in the wind. I always attempt to explain whatever coding solution i've concocted with some level of justification (Not necessarily a good one, but a justification nonetheless). It's a very scholastic approach and by extension is riddled with a lot of explanatory text. However, I believe it showcases my thought process, analytical thinking and decision making. Aspects that are difficult to display with coding alone, but just as essential for an aspiring Data Scientist.
