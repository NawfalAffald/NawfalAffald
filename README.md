## :waxing_gibbous_moon: Welcome to my Disastorous Data Science Dungeon :waning_gibbous_moon:
I'm a bacherlor student in Cognitive Data Science and i created this GitHub with the intend to display not just the skill i've acquired but the journey to get there. The content within it is plagued with unnecessarily sassy comments and too much storytelling. The condition is terminal and though i try to limit the brassiness it somehow always manage to seep into my content. So for any future employees or talent acqusition please disregard the username and excessive sass.

## Skills & Technologies
- _Programming Languages:_ Python, Javascript(Typescript), F#, C# (Unity), VBA / Officescripts
- _Web Development:_ HTML, CSS, React, Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator
- _Tools:_ Git, Excel
- _Databases:_ There should definetily be something here...
- _Libraries:_ NumPy, Pandas :panda_face:, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Plotly, Altair

## Projects
So far, projects have been purely self-indulged and for educational purposes and practice, pertaining to whatever i found interesting at that moment. I always attempt to explain whatever coding solution i've concocted with justification of my decision. It's a very scholastic approach and by extension is riddled with a lot of text, however i believe it showcases my though process, analytical thinking and descision making. Aspects that are difficult to display with coding alone, but just as essential for an aspiring Data Scientist.
